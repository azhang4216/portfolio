# Angela's Personal Portfolio

## Description and Credits
This portfolio is forked from [tbakerx's react resume template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template). Besides personalizing the content, I used [particles-bg](https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg), a react background particle library to make the home page more dynamic.

### What I Hope to Implement In the Future
- hosting on my own domain (not just github pages)
- a filtering system for my projects based on category
- popup / expanding effect when hovering over my projects
